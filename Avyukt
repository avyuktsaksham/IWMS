2 industrial water quality system

Project overview

The " industrial water quality monitor system" project is designed to ensure that water used in industrial processes meets required quality standards. By deploying IIoT sensors and utilizing machine learning, this system will continuously monitor parameters such as pH, turbidity, and contaminant levels, enabling early detection of quality issues and ensuring compliance with environmental regulations.

Objectives 

1. Continuous monitoring: Track water quality parameters in real life. 
2. Early detection: Identify contamination before they impact production or the environment. 
3. Ensure compliance : Maintain adherence to environmental  safety regulations.
4. Optimize Water Usage: Improve efficiency in water consumption and treatment processes.
5. Reduce Operational Costs: Minimize costs associated with water quality issues and regulatory fines.

Key Components
1. IIot Water Quality Sensors: Measure parameters like pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, and contaminant levels.
2. Data Aggregation Platform: Collect and store sensor data for analysis.
3. Machine learning Models: Analyze water quality trends and predict potential contamination events.
